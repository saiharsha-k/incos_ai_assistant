        "name": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)",
        "description": "RNNs are ideal for sequential data, such as time series or text. They maintain an internal state to process sequences of inputs, making them great for tasks like natural language processing and speech recognition."
      },
      {
        "name": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)",
        "description": "GANs are used for generating new data, such as images or audio, by training two models in a competitive setting. They are useful in creative fields like image synthesis and data augmentation."
      },
      {
        "name": "Transformer Networks",
        "description": "Transformers are designed for processing sequential data in parallel. They are the foundation for models like GPT and BERT, which have achieved state-of-the-art results in tasks like translation, summarization, and language understanding."
      },
      {
        "name": "Autoencoders",
        "description": "Autoencoders are used for unsupervised learning tasks, such as anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction. They learn to compress data into a lower-dimensional representation and then reconstruct it."

      {
        "name": "Reinforcement Learning",
        "description": "Reinforcement learning involves training models to make decisions by interacting with an environment. It is commonly used in robotics, gaming, and autonomous systems."
